    <center><h2>#Ode to Rod: The Web Weaver </h2>
        <span>In the <span class="p1">realm</span> of ones and zeros,
       Where <span class="p1">pixels</span> dance and <span class="p1">code</span> unfurls,
       There resides a silent sorcerer,
       A <span class="p1">**web weaver**</span> with dreams and <span class="p1">pearls</span>.</span> 
       
       <h2>## I. The Blank Canvas </h2>
       
       <span><span class="p1">Rod</span>, the <span class="p2">**alchemist of the browser**,</span> 
       Wields his <span class="p1">keyboard</span> like a <span class="p1">wand</span>,
       He conjures <span class="p1">pages</span> from thin air,
       <span class="p1">Painting</span> landscapes with lines so fond. </span>
       
       <h2>## II. The HTML Symphony </h2>
       <span>His <span class="p1">fingers</span> dance upon the <span class="p1">keys</span>,
       Crafting <span class="p1">tags</span> like musical notes,
       <span class="p1">HTML</span> whispers secrets to the breeze,
       As <span class="p1">Rod</span> orchestrates <span class="p1">symphonies</span> in quotes.</span>
       
        <h2>## III. The CSS Enchanter </h2>
       <span>Next, he dons his <span class="p1">**CSS cloak**</span>,
       <span class="p1">Styling</span> elements with flair and grace,
       <span class="p1">Colors bloom, fonts sing,</span> layouts <span class="p1">evoke</span>,
       A <span class="p1">visual</span> ballet in this digital space. </span>
        
       <h2>## IV. The JavaScript Magician </h2>
    <span>But wait, the <span class="p1">magic</span> deepens still,
    <span class="p1">Rod</span> summons <span class="p2">**JavaScript spells**</span>,
       Interactivity blooms at his <span class="p1">will</span>,
       <span class="p1">Forms</span> validate, <span class="p1">animations propel</span>. </span>
       
       <h2>## V. The Debugging Sage </h2>
    <span>Yet, <span class="p1">bugs</span> creep in like shadows dark,
    <span class="p1">Rod</span> dons his <span class="p2">**debugging spectacles**</span>,
       Chasing <span class="p1">glitches</span> through the <span class="p1">code's arc</span>,
       He <span class="p1">tames</span> wild loops and elusive <span class="p1">variables</span>. </span>
       
       <h2>## VI. The Responsive Voyager</h2>
       
       <span><span class="p1">Across</span> screens, <span class="p1">devices</span>, and dimensions,
       <span class="p1">Rod</span> sails on the <span class="p2">**responsive sea**,</span>
       Media queries <span class="p1">guide</span> his intentions,
       <span class="p1">Adapting</span> layouts with <span class="p1">fluidity</span>. </span>
       
       <h2>## VII. The SEO Whisperer</h2>
       <span>In the <span class="p1">labyrinth</span> of search engines,
       <span class="p1">Rod</span> becomes an <span class="p2">**SEO whisperer**</span>,
       <span class="p1">Meta tags</span>, keywords, backlink strings,
       He crafts pathways to digital <span class="p1">wanderers</span>.</span>
       
       <h2>## VIII. The Git Alchemist</h2>
       <span>Version control, a <span class="p1">mystical potion</span>,
       <span class="p1">Rod</span> brews commits in <span class="p1">Git's</span> cauldron,
       Branches fork, <span class="p1">merge</span> conflicts in motion,
       His <span class="p1">repository</span> a saga of <span class="p1">code</span> reborn. </span>
       
       <h2>## IX. The Deployment Dreamer</h2>
       
       <span>And when the <span class="p1">moon</span> kisses the horizon,
       <span class="p1">Rod</span> unfurls his creation to the <span class="p1">world</span>,
       <span class="p1">Deployments</span> like shooting stars, arisen,
       His <span class="p1">website</span> sails, its sails <span class="p1">unfurled</span>. </span>
       
      <h2>## X. The Web Developer's Anthem</h2>
       
       <span>So here's to <span class="p1">Rod</span>, the <span class="p1">**web developer**</span>, 
       A poet of <span class="p1">pixels</span>, a composer of <span class="p1">clicks</span>,
       In the <span class="p1">binary</span> symphony, he's the reveler,
       Weaving dreams into the digital <span class="p1">matrix</span>. </span>
    <br><br>
       <span><span class="p3">*Rod, may your lines be bug-free,
       May your CSS always cascade gracefully,
       And may your JavaScript forever flow,
       As you navigate the web's eternal ebb and flow.*</span></span>
